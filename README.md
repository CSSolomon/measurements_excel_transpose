# Introduction

This program processes the excel files generated by the XXXX measurement tool to introduce two new sheets:

* An `Aggregates` sheet, that places the metabolites in rows, with each colum representing the areas of different injections
* An `Aggregates_formulas` sheet, that contains formulas averaging values in the first introduced sheet

The program has been written as an extensible solution to the needs of a specific lab, however it is meant to be readable and extensible by anyone with average programming skills.

# Use

At its core, the program may be used as simply as `${PATH}/excel_converter.py -f <input_filename> -o <output_filename>`. Keep in mind that the output filename **MUST** contain the `.xlsx` suffix. Without the `-o <output_filename>` option, the program will simply log the contents of the two sheets it generates.

## Full call options

Below is the help message generated from version `0.1.0` of the tool:

```text
usage: excel_converter.py [-h] -f FILENAME [-o OUTPUT] [-l NOR_LEUCINE_KEY]
                          [--log-level LOG_LEVEL]
                          [--log-level-cli {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL,10,20,30,40,50}]
                          [--log-level-file {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL,10,20,30,40,50}]
                          [--log-no-cli] [--log-in-file]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILENAME, --filename FILENAME
                        The input file to parse
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        The file to output results into
  -l NOR_LEUCINE_KEY, --nor-leucine-key NOR_LEUCINE_KEY
                        The name of the sheet containing the Nor-Leucine data
  --log-level LOG_LEVEL
                        Log level to use
  --log-level-cli {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL,10,20,30,40,50}
                        Log level to use for CLI. Using this force-enables CLI
                        logging with maximum priority
  --log-level-file {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL,10,20,30,40,50}
                        Log level to use. Using this force-enables file
                        logging with max priority
  --log-no-cli          Skip CLI logging
  --log-in-file         Activate logging to file
  ```

### Input - output modifying options

| Option                     | Comment                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-f` / `--filename`        | The file to parse and extend. **Must** have a well-known format           |
| `-o` / `--output`          | The file to create with the results.                                      |
| `-l` / `--nor-leucine-key` | Key of the sheet containing the baseline metabolite. Defaults to `Nor`    |

### Logging modification options

| Option                    | Comment                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--log-level`             | The global log-level to set. Does not impact activation of types of logging        |
| `--log-level-cli`         | Level CLI logging will use. Activates CLI logging if set with maximum precedence   |
| `--log-level-file`        | Level file logging will use. Activates file logging if set with maximum precedence |
| `--log-no-cli`            | Deactivates CLI logging (on by default). No impact if CLI level is set             |
| `--log-in-file`           | Activates file logging (off by default). If file level is set automatically True   |

The log levels one can set can have a value of:

| Level              | Significance
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  `10` / `DEBUG`    | Be very verbose. Will show intermediate steps of processing and internals of the function of the script |
|  `20` / `INFO`     | Be verbose a regular amount. This is the default level for most programs, including the CLI of this one |
|  `30` / `WARNING`  | Be silent, only showing warning or above messages. Warning means things almost failed but didn't        |
|  `40` / `ERROR`    | Be very silent, only printing out messages if an error has occured                                      |
|  `50` / `CRITICAL` | Be extrememly silent, only reporting catastrophic failure. This is meaningless for this software        |

It is recommended to keep CLI output in `INFO` level (default) and activate file-logging (default level: `DEBUG`) if more information is
needed. The logfile can be found in the path from which the script was called and will be named as `<program_name without .py suffix>.log`
